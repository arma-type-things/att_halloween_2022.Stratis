# att_halloween_2022.Stratis

We used several mods for ambiance, but the map only requires `Devourering's Necroplague Mutants`, and `Not what they seem...`. Playing from this source is the best way to do that without all of the mods the PBO requires.

To use from source:

```
cd "\Path\To\Arma 3\MPMissions"
git clone https://github.com/tsal/att_halloween_2022.Stratis.git
```

Open `att_halloween.Stratis` in Eden, ignore warnings, then save. This will clean out any mods you don't want to require beyond the three (? TBD) listed above.
